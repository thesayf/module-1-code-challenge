# Object Relations Code Challenge

For this assignment, we'll be working with a Yelp-style domain. We have three models - `Restaurant`, `Customer`, and `Review`.
For our purposes, a `Restaurant` has many `Reviews`, a `Customer` has many `Reviews`, and a `Review` belongs to a `Customer` and to a `Restaurant`.
`Restaurant` - `Customer` is a many to many relationship.

If you are not sketching out your domain, and thinking about single source of truth,
you are doing it wrong :(

## Topics

- Classes vs Instances
- Variable Scope ( Class, Instance, Local )
- Object Relationships
- Arrays and Array Methods
- Class Methods

## Notes

Your goal is to build out all of the methods listed in the deliverables. Do your best to follow Ruby best practices. For example, use higher-level array methods such as `map`, `select`, and `find` when appropriate in place of `each`

We've provided you with a console that you can use to test your code. To enter a console session, run `ruby tools/console.rb` from the command line. You'll be able to test out the methods that you write here. Take a look at that file to see how you can pre-define variables and create object instances, rather than manually doing it in every single console session.

**Remember!** This is a code challenge without tests. You cannot run `rspec` you cannot run `learn`. You'll need to create your own sample instances for testing purposes. Make sure your associations and methods work in the console before submitting.

## Deliverables

### Basic methods

- `Customer.all`
  - should return **all** of the customer instances
- `Restaurant.all`
  - returns an array of all restaurants
- `Review.all`
  - returns all of the reviews

### Associations and Aggregate Methods

#### Customer

<!-- - `Customer#add_review(restaurant, content, rating)`
  - given a **restaurant object**, some review content (as a string), and a star rating (as an integer), creates a new review and associates it with that customer and restaurant. -->
<!-- - `Customer#num_reviews`
  - Returns the total number of reviews that a customer has authored -->
<!-- - `Customer#restaurants`
  - Returns a **unique** array of all restaurants a customer has reviewed -->

#### Restaurant

<!-- - `Restaurant#customers`
  - Returns a **unique** list of all customers who have reviewed a particular restaurant. -->
<!-- - `Restaurant#reviews`
  - returns an array of all reviews for that restaurant -->
<!-- - `Restaurant#average_star_rating`
  - returns the average star rating for a restaurant based on its reviews -->
- `Restaurant#longest_review`
  - returns the longest review content for a given restaurant

### Class Methods and Properties

#### Build the following methods on the `Customer` class

- `Customer.find_by_name(name)`
  - given a string of a **full name**, returns the **first customer** whose full name matches
- `Customer.find_all_by_first_name(name)`
  - given a string of a first name, returns an **array** containing all customers with that first name
- `Customer.all_names`
  - should return an **array** of all of the customer full names

#### Build out the following method on the `Restaurant` class

- `Restaurant.find_by_name(name)`
  - given a string of restaurant name, returns the first restaurant that matches

#### Build out the following methods on the `Review` class

- `Review#customer`
  - returns the customer object for that given review
  - Once a review is created, I should not be able to change the author
- `Review#restaurant`
  - returns the restaurant object for that given review
  - Once a review is created, I should not be able to change the restaurant
- `Review#rating`
  - returns the star rating for a restaurant. This should be an integer from 1-5
- `Review#content`
  - returns the review content, as a string, for a particular review
